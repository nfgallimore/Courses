Creates a method named processFile that takes a single Scanner parameter named input and doesn't return anything. 
If the file has a new line, a new string called first is created and set to the new line.
If the file has another line, a second string is created and set to the second line and then it is printed.
The method then prints the first string. 

	Example:

		Robin
		Hood

	Would be printed as:

		Hood
		Robin

The while loop is then repeated until it no longer has a new line.

		System.exit(0);

    	else if (n == 1) return s;
    	return s + repeat(s, n - 1);
}
